# Stack
Linear data structure that follows LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) order.

## Operations
- Push: It adds an item in the stack. In case the stack is full then it's an Overflow condition.
- Pop: It removes an item from the stack in the reversed order. In case the stack is empty then it's an Underflow condition.
- Peek/Top: It returns the top element of stack.
- isEmpty: It returns true if stack is empty otherwise false.

## Time Complexities
push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all operations take O(1) time.

## Implementation
There are two ways to implement stack.
- Using Array.
- Using Linked List.
